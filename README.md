### Built with

- HTML Grid
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned:

- How to space using margins
- How to shape corners using the 'border-radius' property
- How to center align text
- How to style the font family using google fonts

```css
.this-property-was-fun {
  border-radius: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

As a beginner, I would like to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript as a short term goal, and subsequently lear other programming languages that would be useful for a
career in web development.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)- This helped me style my text to the project specifications. I will be using this resource again in the future
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) - This resource explained how to use the border-radius property to round corners of my div and image.
